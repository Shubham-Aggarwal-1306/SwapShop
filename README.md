SwapShop is an innovative platform that redefines the approach to sustainable living by facilitating the exchange of surplus items within local communities.

The website begins with a login prompt followed by the main feed page where all the recently added items ( in the local vicinity ) are listed and anyone in need of those item can request them from their owner and they could share the item. Additionally , A user could also choose to donate a surplus item or demand any item that they might need.

This collaborative exchange not only reduces waste but also fosters a sense of unity among community members.
